# For learning how to use Typescript

## So far I have learned...
1. How to declare typed variables
2. How the type "any" tends to come up and how to avoid it
3. How to declare functions that specify both the *input* and *output* types
4. Learned about type "void"
5. Learned about type "never"
6. How to use typing in object handling (both input and output of function)
7. Using the "type" keyword to make custom types
8. Using the "readonly" keyword and using "?" to make params optional
9. Making advanced types from other types/custom types
10. How to type arrays
11. Using union typing "|" to allow multiple types
12. Interfaces
  - having properties whose type is a function (with param and return types also specified)
  - using Interfaces to define the shape of a function
  - reopening interfaces
  - inheritance of interfaces
  - Other interface features include Class Types, Indexable Types, and Hybrid Types
